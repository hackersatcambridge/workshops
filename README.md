# Hackers at Cambridge Workshops Index
This repository serves as an index of all workshops that the Hackers at Cambridge community have run.

To add a new workshop:

- First clone the [example workshop repository](https://github.com/hackersatcambridge/workshop-example) into the Hackers at Cambridge GitHub organisation and name the repository `workshop-(your-workshop-name)`, replacing `(your-workshop-name)` with the name of your workshop, with words separated by hyphens. You may need the _workshop organiser_ to do this if you don't have access to the organisation.
- Make the necessary changes to your workshop repository
- Make a pull request to add your repository to the end of the `workshops.yaml` file. Tag the _workshops overseer_ and your _workshop editor_ in the pull request.
- The reviewers will look at your repository and check that it is ready to be added to the index. When it is approved, it'll be merged into this index!
